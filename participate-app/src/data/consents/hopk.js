        <li>You are being asked to join a research study. This consent form explains the research study and your part in it. Please read it carefully and take as much time as you need. Ask your study doctor or the study team to explain any words or information that you do not understand.</li>
        <li>You are a volunteer.  If you join the study, you can change your mind later.  There will be no penalty or loss of benefits if you decide to quit the study.</li>
        <li>During the study, we will tell you if we learn any new information that might affect whether you wish to continue to participate.</li>
        <li>If we think your participation in this study may affect your clinical care, information about your study participation will be included in your medical record, which is used throughout Johns Hopkins.   Doctors outside of Johns Hopkins may not have access to this information.  You can ask the research team to send this information to any of your doctors.</li>
        <li>When Johns Hopkins is used in this consent form, it includes The Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Howard County General Hospital, Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, Suburban Hospital, Sibley Memorial Hospital and All Children’s Hospital.</li>
        <li>The person being asked to be in this research study may not be able to give consent to be in this study.  You are therefore being asked to give permission for this person to be in the study as his/her decision maker.</li>

      <p>The purpose of this research study is to compare how sensitive tablet-based (iPad) interactions like games or tests are for measuring mental abilities like memory, attention, and motor function compared to the traditional pencil-and-paper assessments.</p>
      <p>People diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Primary Progressive Aphasia, Dementia with Lewy bodies, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal Degeneration, Parkinson disease, or Stroke may join this study.</p>
      <p>This study is also looking for healthy participants to take part.</p>

      <p>If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you some “screening questions” to find out if you qualify for the study.  Your ability to participate in the study will be assessed by your score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which will be administered by trained study staff during your first study visit.  The MoCA helps us determine whether you are fully able to assess the risks and benefits of participating in this study at the current time.  If you do not quality, you will not participate further.  If you do qualify, we will ask you to do the following things:</p>
      <p>You will be asked to identify a “study partner,” an individual (spouse, friend or relative) who is willing to participate in each study visit and tell us about changes in your health and daily functioning prior to and during the time you are in the study.</p>
      <p>We will ask you to complete up to 3 (three) in-person visits at our Johns Hopkins offices, with each visit being 6 months apart.</p>
      <p>This study tests an experimental device. You are being asked to take part in a research study of an experimental device called Miro, developed by The Cognitive Healthcare Company (TCHC). This device is being tested for assessing brain function. “Experimental” means that the study device is currently being tested. It is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of tablet-based assessments of memory, attention, language, social and motor function to traditional clinical assessments.</p>

      <h5>In-Person Visit – Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Mental Abilities:</h5>
      <p>You will be asked to participate in an in-person visit. During the visit, a study staff will ask you and your study partner questions about your general health, your medications, medical history and your mental abilities.  We will then proceed to cognitive testing in the form of paper-and-pencil and iPad based applications. An electronic flip of a coin will decide if you will be given the paper-and-pencil test or the iPad tests first. You will be asked to look at pictures; name objects; read and remember words and series of numbers; and tap objects on an iPad screen.  You will also be asked to perform two simple tasks at the same time.  The testing is divided into several sections, with rest periods in between sections, and the testing can be continued during another session. Before each task, the nature of the task will be explained to you. Each visit will take about 2-3 hours in total.</p>

      <h5>Optional Clinical and Cognitive Data Storage and Sharing for Future Use </h5>
      <p>The clinical and cognitive data collected at each visit will be stored in a computer. These data will be analyzed by investigators at Johns Hopkins. The data you are providing will also be shared with other researchers studying atypical parkinsonian disorders and other movement and memory-impairing disorders of the brain. This may include researchers at other academic centers or companies. No names will be used or other identifiers on the data to link the results to a specific person. All information related to the data will be assigned a code. All data will be stored by code and no identifying information will be included with them. Study investigators will maintain and be responsible for deciding how the clinical and cognitive information you provide will be used. All links with your identity will be removed from the data before it is stored or shared. Only data which does not include anything that might directly identify you will be shared with researchers at other sites. Any information gained from this research will be reported in an anonymous summary form.</p>

    <React.Fragment>
      <p>There are no known health risks associated with the paper-and-pencil and iPad-based tests in this study, You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or you are completing questionnaires. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.</p>
      <p>Information about your performance on the cognitive assessment, including scores, photographs of your drawings, audiotapes of your picture descriptions, and dates and times of that you performed the assessments, and diagnosis, linked to a code will be transferred to the Cognitive Healthcare Company. None of your protected health information such as your medical record number, social security number, name, date of birth, address, will be transferred outside of Johns Hopkins. Your name and other personal information will be protected as much as possible, on a computer with passwords known only to study team members or under lock and key. However, there is always some risk to breach of privacy.</p>

      <p>There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study. However, this research will help doctors and scientists learn more about the causes of Alzheimer disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Primary Progressive Aphasia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal Degeneration, Parkinson disease, and Stroke, and may lead to improved diagnostic accuracy. If you take part in this study, you may help others in the future.</p>

If you choose not to be in the study, your physician may recommend that you have the paper and pencil assessments of cognitive function as clinical tests (not part of the study). </p>

      <p>We have rules to protect information about you.  Federal and state laws and the federal medical Privacy Rule also protect your privacy.  By signing this form you provide your permission, called your “authorization,” for the use and disclosure of information protected by the Privacy Rule.</p>
      <p>The research team working on the study will collect information about you.  This includes things learned from the procedures described in this consent form.  They may also collect other information including your name, address, date of birth, and information from your medical records (which may include information about HIV status, drug, alcohol or STD treatment, genetic test results, or mental health treatment).</p>
      <p>The research team will know your identity and that you are in the research study.  Other people at Johns Hopkins, particularly your doctors, may also see or give out your information. We make this information available to your doctors for your safety.</p>
