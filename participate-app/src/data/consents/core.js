      <p>You are being asked to volunteer because you expressed interest in volunteering for Research Study participation. The details of this study are included in this form. If you decide to participate, you’ll be asked to sign this document and will receive a copy for your records. Participation is voluntary. You aren’t obligated to join a Research Study.</p>

  title   : 'What is the purpose of this study?',
  content : (
    <React.Fragment>
      <p>This study will evaluate the Miro app’s ability to measure neurological functions including language, speech, memory, attention, emotion, motor and vision. This research may ultimately help clinicians to gain insight into healthy aging and the reliable measurement of neurological and psychiatric status.</p>
      <p>When you use Miro, your data will be stored as described in the User Agreement. The purpose of this study is to combine your de-identified data with de-identified data from other individuals. Combining data allows statisticians to analyze the performance of Miro’s tools and may help Miro to improve its product and services.</p>
      <p>Miro’s use in medical settings is still experimental. “Experimental” means that the study device is currently being tested. It is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not intended to diagnose, treat or otherwise mitigate health conditions or influence health decisions. In this study, the app is not being used as a medical device, but data from this study will be used to see if the app can be developed into a medical device.</p>

      <p>When you use the Miro Mobile Application, you participate in a number of mobile activities that can help assess neurological function. We are asking for you to grant Miro permission to use a de-identified version of your data for further research and analysis.</p>
      <p>About twenty to thirty minutes of your time is needed to participate in the study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To ensure that you fully understand the study, we will ask you to answer a few multiple-choice questions. </li>
        <li>To confirm that you are a real person (not an online robot), and to show the FDA that each anonymized data sample is provided by a unique individual, we ask that you verify your identity. To do this, please take a picture of you and your driver’s license, state-issued ID or passport when the mobile application prompts you to do so. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are eligible to participate in the study, you will be asked to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign an electronic consent form</li>
        <li>Provide permission to use your data for research</li>
        <li>Answer questions about your health, medical conditions, and therapies</li>
        <li>Answer questions about your lifestyle and use of mobile devices</li>
        <li>Provide feedback about Miro’s Mobile Application</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may be asked to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take a brief assessment by phone or video chat called The Montreal Cognitive Assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have been diagnosed neurological or psychiatric condition, you will be asked to provide permission to contact your diagnosing clinician to confirm your diagnosis and medications. To do this, you will provide your clinician’s contact information on a signed, digital release form.</p>
