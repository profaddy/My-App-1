      <p>You have been invited to participate in a research study because you have access to a mobile device and have expressed interest in remote participation in one of our research studies. You may be a healthy adult or adult with a neurologic or psychiatric condition. Participation in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to participate, there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The details of this study will be discussed with you and are included in this form. Should you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will receive a copy for your records.</p>

  title   : 'What is the purpose of this study?',
  content : (
    <React.Fragment>
      <p>This research study provides insight into interactive mobile technology’s ability to measure neurological functions including language, memory, attention, emotion, motor and vision. This research may ultimately help clinicians to gain insight into healthy aging and the reliable measurement of neurological and psychiatric status.</p>
      <p>You are being asked to take part in a research study of an experimental device called Miro. This device is being tested for assessing cognitive function. “Experimental” means that the study device is currently being tested. It is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of mobile-based assessments to traditional clinical assessments in unsupervised settings.</p>
      <h5>DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INTEREST</h5>
      <p>The principal investigator has a financial interest in the Miro device and benefit financially if the product is successful.</p>

      <p>Before you begin, you will need to complete this consent form before any study procedures are done.  You will also read and sign an End User Licensing Agreement for use of the software product.</p>
      <p>Participation in this study requires access to a mobile device, and can involve a single session, or three sessions separated by one week each. Whether you participate in a single session or three sessions depends on the results of your screening.  All participation occurs remotely, unless you are able and would like to come to a partner research site near you.  In this case, a mobile device could be provided to you for use while participating in the study.</p>
      <p>Following completion of these consent forms, the following “screening” procedures will be done to find out if you can be in the study and how many sessions you will be asked to complete.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will answer questions about your health, lifestyle, daily functioning, mood, medical conditions and any medicines you are taking or have taken (including over-the-counter medicine, vitamins or herbal supplements). These will be collected via questionnaires on an iPad.</li>
        <li>Provide your demographics, including age, education, gender, and ethnicity.</li>
        <li>Perform a cognitive assessment called The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) over video chat to confirm your eligibility (“T-MoCA”). This test will be administered by trained study staff during your first study visit. The T-MoCA helps us determine whether you are fully able to assess the risks and benefits of participating in this study at the current time.</li>
        <li>Since this study is completed remotely and unsupervised, to confirm that you are a real person (not an online robot), and to confirm with the FDA that each de-identified data sample is provided by a unique individual, we ask that you verify your identity. To do this, please take a picture of your driver’s license, state-issued ID or passport and show it to the study team during the video chat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The results of these assessments will determine your eligibility to continue in the study.  Depending on the results, you may be asked to participate in only a single test session, of to complete three test sessions over three weeks.  To continue, you will be asked to complete additional procedures to participate in the study, as described below.</p>

    <React.Fragment>
      <p>After completing the consent and eligibility procedures described above, if you continue to meet the study criteria you will then be asked to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform a series of computerized tests on an iPad.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The activities included in the computerized “games” or tests, which include things like talking out loud, naming objects in pictures, reading and remembering words and numbers, tapping objects on the screen, performing two simple tasks at the same time and other similar tasks. The mobile device application will record your voice and videos of you during the study. At the beginning and the end of the games, you will be asked a few questions about your experience doing the research testing. Your first session playing these games is considered your “Baseline”.  The results of your baseline and the screening procedures determine whether you will be asked to complete additional test sessions.  If you are eligible and invited to complete additional test sessions, you will be asked whether anything has changed in your health or lifestyle since your last test.  Volunteers are encouraged to keep all lifestyle habits and medications consistent across sessions while they are in the study unless it is not medically feasible to do so.</p>

    <React.Fragment>
      <p>If you participate in this study, participation may occur immediately following screening.  The screening takes 30-40 minutes, and the test games take 1 hour.  The study staff will inform you whether you qualify to complete 1 session, or 3 sessions.  Each of the additional sessions last about 1 hour.  If you qualify for the repeat sessions, they will be separated by 1 week each. For volunteers that are eligible to do the second and third sessions, they will involve use of Miro at the same time of day as your initial assessment.   You will receive a reminder email notifying you of when you are expected to log back in to do the tests again.</p>
