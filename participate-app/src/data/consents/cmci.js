      <p>You have been invited to participate in a research study because you have been diagnosed with a neurologic condition and are between the ages of 64-85. This diagnosis has been made on the basis of your own self-report and/or your doctor’s examination and the results of tests that have been performed. Participation in the study is voluntary. If you choose not to participate, or decide to withdraw, there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The details of this study will be discussed with you and are included in this form. Should you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will receive a copy for your records.</p>

  content : (
    <React.Fragment>
      <p>This research study will provide insight into interactive mobile technology’s ability to measure neurological functions including language, memory, attention, emotion, motor and vision. This research will ultimately help clinicians to gain insight into healthy aging and the reliable measurement of neurological and psychiatric status.</p>
      <p>You are being asked to take part in a research study of an experimental device called Miro. This device is being tested for assessing cognitive function. “Experimental” means that the study device is currently being tested. It is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of mobile-based assessments to traditional clinical assessments.</p>
      <h5>DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INTEREST</h5>
      <p>The principal investigator has a financial interest in the Miro device and benefit financially if the product is successful.</p>

      <p>Before you begin, you will need to complete this consent form before any study procedures are done.  You will also read and sign an End User Licensing Agreement for use of the software product.</p>
      <p>Following completion of these consent forms, the following will be done to find out if you can be in the study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform a cognitive assessment called The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to confirm your eligibility. This test will be administered by trained study staff during your first study visit. The MoCA helps us determine whether you are fully able to assess the risks and benefits of participating in this study at the current time.</li>
        <li>If you continue to be eligible based on this assessment, you will answer questions about your health, lifestyle, daily functioning, mood, medical conditions and any medicines you are taking or have taken (including over-the-counter medicine, vitamins or herbal supplements). These will be collected via questionnaires on a iPad.</li>
        <li>Provide your demographics, including age, education, gender, and ethnicity.</li>
        <li>Pass a urine drug screening.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The results of these assessments will determine your eligibility to continue in the study.  If so, you will be asked to complete additional procedures to participate in the study, as described below.</p>

      <p>The activities included in the paper and pencil and computerized tests include things like talking out loud, naming objects in pictures, reading and remembering words and numbers, tapping objects on the screen, performing two simple tasks at the same time and other similar tasks. The mobile device will record your voice and videos of you during the study. At the beginning and the end of the study, you will be asked a few questions about your experience doing the research testing.</p>
